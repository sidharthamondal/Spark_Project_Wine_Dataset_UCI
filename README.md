# Spark_Project_Wine_Dataset_UCI
Analytics Using BigDATA spark in python on the famous WINE dataset from UCI

This is a very basic project done in PySpark , as I have done this full project in a collab environment , it will not work in a 
local machine .
Installing spark is a cumbersome and hence I have used google collab 
This Project is a Classification problem and aims to help the basics of Spark terminologies and how vectorization works 
The Details of the whole code is explained properly in the Ipython notebook
